Can quantum computers actually help doctors? I built an 8-qubit circuit that looks at blood cells and spots leukemia (AML) with 48.9% accuracy on real patient data from cancer archives. Same performance as classical methods but with 22Ã— fewer parameters - suggesting quantum might have an edge as hardware improves.

This isn't another toy dataset demo. These are actual blood samples from hospitals. I'm tackling a real problem: AML diagnosis requires specialists who aren't available everywhere, especially in rural areas.

Everything's open-source so the community can build on it. If quantum computing is going to matter beyond academic papers, we need to prove it works on problems that actually help people.
