Our project applies quantum computing to medical diagnostics via automated blood cell classification for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) detection. We developed an 8-qubit Variational Quantum Circuit achieving 48.9% accuracy on real medical datasets from The Cancer Imaging Archive, matching classical methods while using 22Ã— fewer parameters.

This bridges quantum computing with healthcare, providing automated diagnostic screening to assist pathologists. Our open-source framework establishes foundations for quantum advantage in medical AI.

Benefits: First practical quantum ML on real medical data, open-source quantum medical AI framework, comparative quantum vs classical analysis, educational resource for quantum healthcare applications.

We bring quantum computing and medical AI expertise with demonstrated results on clinical datasets.
