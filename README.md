# Unitary Foundation Grant Application

This repository contains the complete application materials for the Unitary Foundation grant submission for the "Quantum-Enhanced Medical Diagnostics: Blood Cell Classification for AML Detection" project.

## Project Overview

Our project demonstrates the practical application of quantum computing to medical diagnostics through automated blood cell classification for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) detection. We have developed an 8-qubit Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) that achieves 48.9% accuracy on real medical datasets from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), matching the performance of classical energy-based methods while using 22× fewer parameters.

## Key Achievements

- **Working VQC Implementation**: 8-qubit quantum circuit with demonstrated performance on real medical data
- **Real Medical Data Integration**: Successfully processing TCIA clinical datasets 
- **Comprehensive Comparison**: VQC vs Equilibrium Propagation analysis showing quantum parameter efficiency
- **Open-Source Framework**: Complete codebase with documentation and visualizations
