This bridges quantum computing with healthcare, providing automated diagnostic screening to assist pathologists. Our open-source framework establishes foundations for quantum advantage in medical AI.

Benefits: First practical quantum ML on real medical data, open-source quantum medical AI framework, comparative quantum vs classical analysis, educational resource for quantum healthcare applications.

We bring quantum computing and medical AI expertise with demonstrated results on clinical datasets.
