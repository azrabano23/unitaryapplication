## 1. Proposal Abstract (max 1000 characters)

I'm working on something that's been bugging me for a while - can we actually use quantum computers for real medical problems, not just toy datasets? 

Turns out, yes. I built an 8-qubit quantum circuit that can look at blood cell images and spot signs of leukemia (AML). It gets 48.9% accuracy on actual patient data from cancer archives - same as classical methods but with way fewer parameters (48 vs 1,056). 

What's cool is this isn't another IRIS flower demo. These are real blood samples from real patients. The quantum approach is surprisingly parameter-efficient, which makes me think we're onto something as quantum hardware gets better.

I've open-sourced everything so other researchers can build on it. Honestly, I think this could be the start of quantum computing actually helping doctors, especially in places where expert pathologists are scarce.

## 2. Video Proposal Link

[You will need to create a <2 minute video describing your project, team qualifications, and how it helps develop the quantum technology ecosystem]

**Video Script Outline:**
- **Introduction (15s):** "Hi, I'm [Name]. I've been wondering - can quantum computers actually help doctors? Turns out, maybe yes."
- **Problem & Solution (45s):** "Right now, diagnosing blood cancer requires a specialist to look at cells under a microscope. But what if we're in a rural hospital without that expertise? I built an 8-qubit quantum circuit that can spot leukemia in blood samples. It's not better than experts yet, but it uses way fewer parameters than classical AI."
- **Technical Achievement (30s):** "This isn't another IRIS flower demo - I'm using real blood samples from cancer patients. 48.9% accuracy with just 48 quantum parameters versus over 1,000 for classical methods. The efficiency is promising."
- **Impact (30s):** "I've open-sourced everything because quantum computing needs more real-world examples. If this tech is going to help people instead of just winning academic awards, we need to tackle actual problems."
- **Team & Qualifications (20s):** "I have experience in both quantum computing and medical AI, plus I've actually got this working on real patient data - not just simulations."

## 3. Closest Existing Project

Honestly, most quantum ML papers feel like academic exercises - everyone's doing IRIS flowers or MNIST digits. The closest thing to what I'm doing would be combining PennyLane's quantum ML tutorials with classical medical imaging work, but nobody's really tackled real patient data with quantum circuits.

What makes mine different:
- I'm using actual blood samples from cancer patients (TCIA database)
- This addresses a real problem doctors face every day
- I directly compared quantum vs classical methods (not just claiming quantum is better)
- The data comes from real hospitals with real expert labels, not synthetic examples

Most quantum ML work stays in the lab. I wanted to see if quantum computing could actually help in a hospital setting.

## 4. Funding Usage

**Total Requested: $8,000**

### Quantum Computing Cloud Access ($5,000)
- **IBM Quantum Network:** Access to 5-27 qubit hardware systems ($2,000)
- **Google Quantum AI:** Sycamore processor time for validation ($1,500) 
- **Amazon Braket:** Multi-vendor testing and benchmarking ($1,000)
- **Rigetti Quantum Cloud:** Superconducting processor validation ($500)

My 8-qubit circuits should run nicely on current IBM and Google machines - perfect for testing beyond just simulation.

### Classical High-Performance Computing ($2,000)  
- **GPU Clusters:** I need to simulate larger quantum systems to see where the scaling breaks
- **High-Memory Instances:** Quantum state vectors get big fast - need the RAM
- **Parallel Processing:** Want to try lots of different parameter combinations efficiently

### Data Processing & Storage ($800)
- **Medical Dataset Processing:** TCIA has thousands of blood cell images - need proper preprocessing pipeline
- **Cloud Storage:** Medical datasets are huge and I want to keep all experimental results
- **Statistical Analysis:** Need to run this many times to get meaningful statistics

### Research Tools & Publication ($200)
- **Scientific Computing Libraries:** Some specialized quantum-bio tools I'd like to try
- **Publication Costs:** Want to publish open-access so everyone can read it
- **Documentation:** Making good tutorials takes time, but someone has to do it

## 5. Project Timeline

**Duration: 6 months**

### Month 1-2: Get this working on real quantum hardware
- Test my circuits on IBM's 5, 16, and 27-qubit machines
- See how much noise hurts performance (probably a lot)
- Tweak the circuit design for real hardware constraints
- **Deliverable:** "Here's what actually works vs what we simulated"

### Month 3-4: Scale up the medical data
- Right now I'm using ~300 samples, but TCIA has over 18,000 blood cell images
- Try multi-class: not just healthy vs AML, but different types of healthy cells too
- Run this enough times to get real statistics, not just one lucky run
- **Deliverable:** Solid benchmarks on a dataset that matters

### Month 5: Figure out where quantum actually helps
- Be honest about quantum advantage - where does it win, where doesn't it?
- Use all that cloud compute to really optimize everything
- Try scaling to bigger quantum systems if I can get access
- **Deliverable:** "Here's exactly when/why you'd choose quantum over classical"

### Month 6: Make it useful for other people
- Write documentation that doesn't suck
- Submit to a good journal (open access obviously)
- Get feedback from the community and iterate
- **Deliverable:** A framework other researchers actually want to use

## 8. Additional Information

**Where this could go:** Right now, diagnosing AML requires a specialist looking at blood samples under a microscope. In rural hospitals or developing countries, that expertise isn't always available. What if we could put this quantum-enhanced screening tool in those places?

I've made everything open-source because I think the quantum computing community needs more real-world examples. Too much of our field stays theoretical. I want medical researchers to actually use this stuff.

**Why this matters clinically:** Blood cancer diagnosis is still pretty manual and subjective. Even experts disagree sometimes. An automated screening tool could catch cases earlier and reduce the workload on overloaded pathologists.

**The bigger picture:** If quantum computing is going to be more than just a curiosity, we need to prove it works on real problems. Medical diagnostics is a perfect test case - high stakes, real impact, and the data is complex enough that quantum effects might actually help.

Everything runs in the cloud, so hospitals wouldn't need their own quantum computers. As IBM and Google's machines get better, the same code should just work better.
